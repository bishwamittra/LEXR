From v1.2 to v1.3
-----------------
    * New features:
          o DFA and GTA package documentation and examples
          o in_state_space (in WS2S: to test state space)
          o execute (compiles without conjoining)
          o pconst (Presburger constants)
          o inherited-acceptance analysis (in WS2S: state analysis)
          o gta2dot for visualizing GTAs
          o C-style comments (/* .. */)
    * Bug fixes:
          o occasionally wrong free variables read by import
          o occasionally non-minimum counter-example
          o GTA bug (rare error occurring with huge GTAs)
          o recursion on restrictions was not implemented correctly
    * Source-code improvements:
          o interfaces to DFA and GTA packages simplified
          o all memory leaks removed
          o improved Emacs MONA mode
          o guide/universe construction rewritten
          o improved automaton file format
          o all timers now use CPU time
          o DAG code simplified
    * Minor changes:
          o unrestriction now explicit (-u option)
          o command-line usage now more intuitive
          o alphabet now consists of all globally declared variables
          o restr-feature removed (was confusing)
          o use ws1s, ws2s instead of linear, tree

From v1.3 to v1.4
-----------------
    * New features:
          o recursive types for WS2S - this feature allows GTA guides to
	    be specified using a high-level notation, thereby making
	    tree-mode easier to use and more efficient (- this extension
	    of MONA makes the FIDO tool almost superfluous, so no more
	    development will be made on FIDO)
          o formula reductions - before the translation into automata,
	    some reduction techniques are applied, which often reduce
	    translation time (experiments show 5-70% improvement!)
	  o new M2L-Str emulation - now the skeleton is specified using a
	    second-order variable instead of a first-order variable (for
	    compatibility, the old technique is still available using the
	    -m option)
    * Bug fixes:
          o root in WS2S had wrong encoding
          o all var1 globals are now asserted first-order even if not used
          o export and lastpos didn't work together
          o let had wrong scope
          o small bugs in GTA and DFA analysis fixed
          o the last memory leaks removed (this time we mean it :-)
          o occasionally wrong free variables at "where"
          o "include" didn't work properly
    * Source-code improvements:
          o better DAGification (typical 10% time improvement)
          o the notions of implicative and conjunctive automata (which
	    became obsolete when restrictions were added) have been removed
    * Minor changes:
          o better Graphviz DAG dump
          o option -xw added: outputs resulting automaton in external format
          o progress information extended: current number of automata in
	    memory is now shown
