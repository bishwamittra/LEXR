Compiling and installing MONA
-----------------------------

Files are installed in the following directories:

  $(bindir)/         - contains the 'mona' executable
  $(mandir)/         - contains the manual page for 'mona'
  $(datadir)/        - contains 'mona-mode.el' for Emacs

This can be changed by passing appropriate arguments to 'configure'
(see './configure --help').  To configure the same way as RPM does it,
start by running

  config/rpm-config      (arguments are passed on to 'configure')

otherwise, run

  ./configure            (with appropriate configuration switches)

To compile and install, run

  make
  make install-strip     (may require root permissions)

If you run 'make' without 'make install-strip', you should manually
run 'strip mona' to remove symbol table, etc., from the executable.

To uninstall, run

  make uninstall         (may require root permissions)



Building binary RPMs
--------------------

Configuration options (passed to './configure' or 'config/rpm-config')
are also inserted in 'mona.spec'.  This means that if you run

  make rpm

you will get a binary RPM that is tailored for your system.



Building the Lib and Examples programs
--------------------------------------

To compile the programs in the Lib and Examples directories, run

  make lib
  make examples



For developers
--------------

Useful commands:
  config/init              - run aclocal, autoheader, automake, and autoconf
  config/rpm-config        - run configure with RPM configuration
  config/devel             - run init and rpm-config with debug enabled
  make rpm                 - make tar.gz and source+binary RPMs
  make maintainer-clean    - remove all files that can be auto-regenerated
